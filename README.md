# Biocompatibility

This is a simple project where I have used the RandomForestClassifier algorithm in-order to classify a material as bio-compatible or not. This algorithm runs on tkinter and uses 3 features and a biocompatibility 
binary value, to predict. 

### Note:
This is only a sample project as well as a work in progress.
